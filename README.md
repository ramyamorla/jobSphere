## Authentication

JobSphere uses **passwordless, role-based sign-in**. A user is identified by their `username` and `role` (STUDENT or RECRUITER). On first sign-in the account and profile are created automatically. The session is stored in `localStorage` as a JSON object — no tokens or cookies required.

---

## Future Scope

- **AI Resume Analyzer** — parse uploaded resumes with an LLM to extract skills and surface profile gaps
- **Job Match Score** — compute semantic similarity between a student's profile and each job listing using text embeddings
- **AI Cover Letter Generator** — one-click tailored cover letter using the job description and student profile as context
- **Web Scraping Pipeline** — scheduled scraper (Playwright / BeautifulSoup) to pull real listings from LinkedIn, Indeed, and Glassdoor and normalize them into the JobSphere schema
- **Smart Job Alerts** — notify students when newly scraped jobs exceed their personal AI match score threshold
- **Recruiter Writing Assistant** — flag biased language and vague requirements in job postings before they go live
